# MLClassification-Autoencoders-Analysis

In this project, I worked on several machine learning tasks using different datasets. First, I divided the IRIS dataset for training and testing to classify iris flowers using a 2-layer neural network with different activation functions and evaluated the model's accuracy. Then, I trained an autoencoder on the MNIST digits dataset to explore data compression and reconstruction, experimenting with different architectures. Finally, I tackled the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, comparing tree classifiers and random forests under various conditions, including handling missing values and analyzing feature importance.
